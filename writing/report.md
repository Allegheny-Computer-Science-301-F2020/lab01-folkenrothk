### Article 1
- Article name.
 - "Will More Data Make Us Healthier?""

- Reference or article citation.
 - Ovide, Shira. “Will More Data Make Us Healthier?” The New York Times, The New York Times, 28 Aug. 2020, www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/technology/health-tracking-technology.html?searchResultPosition=1.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article is highlighting the hopes of tech companies and their ideals of what health trackers can do for the public within the realistic problems that arise with collecting health data and their unintended consequences.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern is best highlighted with one of the author's last lines; "Think about whether you trust the company behind the health tracker with sensitive information from your body." The biggest concern what manipulation a large tech corporation can do with the personal health data of all of their users.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Health data especially focused on the tracking of heart rate and sleep.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The analysis seems like code created by each company individually to then produce a report to the user. For example, the article highlights the company Fitbit who claims that their sensors can "score your stress level." Other companies are looking to collect and interpret health data in hopes to expand the data in medical records and help catch health problems like heart abnormalities.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Gains would be if the tech companies can deliver their hopes and give consumers a fuller medical record to utilize for their wellbeing. Losses would be in privacy if this data was breached. In the article, the comparison is made between the trackers and giving doctors daily electrocardiograms. Though this seems like amazing innovation, privacy questions arise as you connect the amount of paper work and legal protection there is to our privacy in hospitals and doctors' offices that is not yet implemented on these health trackers.
